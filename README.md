# Clustering Python Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Clustering Python Project! Developed as part of the engineering program at ENSAE during the first year, this program utilizes advanced analytical techniques to create meaningful connections. By answering a series of questions through a user-friendly visual interface, you are matched with a group of people with similar interests and preferences. At the heart of this application is the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique, which effectively reduces the complexity of biological factors for more accurate groupings. In compliance with ENSAE's guidelines, we generate our data in-house, ensuring a unique and tailored experience.

ENSAE had imposed the guideline that external databases could not be used. Therefore, a part of the process involves artificially generating our own data.

## Getting Started

### Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command in the terminal:

This will launch the visual interface. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the questionnaire and discover your matches.

### Usage

The usage of this application is as simple as it is interactive:

Launch the application.
Answer the questionnaire presented by the visual interface.
Upon completion, the program will process your responses.
View the groups of people you are matched with, based on shared responses.

## Requirements

This project requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Scikit-learn

## Notes

This project was completed in 2021 when NLP and LLMs were much less popular. One possible improvement would be to use LLMs to match bios in order to enhance the matching process.
